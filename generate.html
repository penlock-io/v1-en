            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Producing private, provably secure randomness with an electronic
                device is extremely challenging due to its black-box nature. A
                seed phrase generated from unsound randomness is insecure, and a
                flaw in the random number generation, whether intentional or
                accidental, can take years to discover.
            </p>

            <p>
                Penlock offers a simple and straightforward way to generate a
                seed phrase by hand, eliminating any doubts about its security.

            <h3>Components</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to printing and cutting the components linked below,
                you will need a pen, a pencil, an eraser, and the wallet that
                will store the seed phrase.

                    This worksheet can be used to generate, split, and recover a
                    seed phrase. However, if you do not intend to split your
                    seed phrase with Penlock, we recommend using the 12-word
                    recovery card provided by your wallet instead.

                    This file contains the standard wordlist used by most
                    wallets. Each word has been prefixed with a 2-character
                    checksum (the grayed characters).

                    These tiles are used to generate random numbers. After
                    printing and cutting, ensure the value on the tiles is
                    identical on both sides. A detailed check of every tile is
                    not required; if the document was misprinted, none of the
                    tiles will be correct.

                    two series of 32 tiles numbered from 1 to 32. The first
                    series is suffixed with a white dot (◦), the second with a
                    black dot (•). The value must be identical on both sides of
                    every tile.

            <h3>Procedure</h3>

            <h4>Doing This Well</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Prefer a private space where you won't be disturbed</li>
                <li>Keep cameras and prying eyes away</li>
                <li>Avoid pronouncing the results out loud</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>A. Generate the 11 first words</h4>
            <p>
                The first 11 words of a seed phrase are fully random and can be
                generated without further processing. Each tile has a number and
                a dot, and each word is tied to a number-number-dot combination.
                Then:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Shuffle the tiles thoroughly and pick up a random tile.</li>
                <li>
                    On the wordlist, identify the column that starts with the
                    number on the tile (we ignore the dot for now).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put the tile back, shuffle, and pick up a random tile again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the column you previously identified, find the word that
                    matches the number+dot combination on the tile.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the worksheet, write down the first 6 characters under
                    the 'Seedphrase' section, respecting the gray & white
                    backgrounds coding.
                </li>
                <li>Repeat steps 1 to 5 until you have generated 11 words.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>B. Generate the 12th word</h4>
            <p>
                The last word is partly random but also contains a checksum that
                depends on the previous words. We are going to select a random
                group of 16 candidate words, out of which only one can be
                accepted by the wallet. On the wordlist, these groups are
                delimited by black horizontal separators.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Use the tiles to generate a random word, as previously
                    described.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the wordlist, identify the 16-word group that this word
                    is part of.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the wallet, initialize the recovery process and enter the
                    first 11 words, without the grayed characters (checksum),
                    and without the dashes (-).
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the 12th word, try each of the 16 candidate words until
                    one is accepted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the worksheet, write down the valid 12th word under the
                    'Seedphrase' section.
                </li>
            </ol>
