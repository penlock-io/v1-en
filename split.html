            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Seed phrases are a convenient way to back up a wallet while
                maintaining complete ownership. However, they have significant
                disadvantages. If a seed phrase is lost or stolen, the funds can
                be irremediably compromised. Furthermore, planning for
                inheritance requires entrusting the phrase to a third party,
                which again places the funds at risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Penlock's secret-splitting generates 3 (encrypted) shares. Any
                two of these shares can be used to recover the original seed
                phrase, but a single compromised share reveals nothing about it.
                This 2-of-3 backup allows for off-site recovery, as well as
                trust-minimized inheritance.

            <p>
                In addition to printing and assembling the components linked
                below, you will need a pencil, an eraser, a pen, scissors, and
                the seed phrase to split:

                    The worksheet is divided into 4 sections: one for the seed
                    phrase, and three for the shares. Each section contains the
                    same number of word, and words are composed of 6 characters:
                    two with a gray background (for the Penlock checksum), and 4
                    with a white background (for the truncated words). An
                    additional sheet is provided to produce copies of shares 2
                    and 3.

                    The wheel is the primary tool for splitting and recovering
                    the seed phrase. To assemble it, proceed with the following
                    steps:
                </p>

                <ol>

                    <li>
                        On the colored disk, cut out the pointer window, as well
                        as the smaller numbered windows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Attach both disks together at their center using a snap
                        button, a brass fastener, or a pin. Ensure the colored
                        wheel is placed on top and can rotate freely.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The wheel has 4 distinct sections that will be referred to
                    as follows: the pointer, the outer (character) ring, the
                    inner (character) ring, and the numbered spiral.

                    pointer is on '=', each character on the inner ring must be
                    aligned with and identical to the outer ring ones.

                    This file contains the standard wordlist used by most
                    wallets. Each word has been prefixed with a 2-character
                    checksum (the grayed characters). It helps detect and
                    correct mistakes that might occur during the splitting or

            <h3>Designing a Backup Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                Before generating your shares, it is advised to create a clear
                plan for how they will be stored. A good backup strategy is one
                that suits your needs and technical ability. Moreover, the
                recovery process must be easy to remember, even after years, and
                — in the case of inheritance — achievable by your heirs. To help
                you design this strategy, we provide a generic framework that
                you can tailor to your needs.
            </p>

            <h4>Types of Storage</h4>
            <p>
                A suggested type of storage is written on each share. The
                general principle is to force an attacker to execute two
                different types of attacks to gain access to the seed phrase.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Share 1, Digital:</em> Stored on an encrypted device,
                    typically in a password manager. It can optionally be
                    cloud-synced.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Share 2, Social:</em> Give copies to 2 or 3 trusted
                    people, and possibly keep one at home.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Share 3, Legal (Optional):</em> This share is meant to
                    be stored in a safe deposit box or included as part of a
                    will. If this is not possible, we recommend not generating
                    this share altogether.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For digital and legal shares, we generally recommend keeping it
                simple by opting for a service provider you already trust and
                use. If this is not an option, familiarize yourself with the new
                service first. Most crucially, always ensure the recovery path
                is properly configured and well understood ahead of time.
            </p>

            <h4>Off-site recovery</h4>
            <p>
                Off-site recovery is an important feature of any backup system.
                In practice, this requires the ability to access two different
                shares from outside your primary residence. The social and legal
                shares typically provide this capability. If you choose not to
                use a legal share, cloud-syncing the digital share is a viable
                alternative.
            </p>

            <h4>Trust-Minimized Inheritance</h4>
            <p>
                Trust-minimized inheritance is achieved by creating a path that
                lets your heir access a second, different share in addition to
                the social share they were already given. There are two ways to
                do this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Legal Inheritance:</em> A safe deposit box can typically
                    be accessed by a chosen person upon the presentation of a
                    death certificate. Alternatively, the legal share can be
                    included as part of a will.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Digital Inheritance:</em> Various online services,
                    including some password managers, offer digital inheritance
                    features. Typically, a chosen person can request access at
                    any time. They will receive the data after a delay period of
                    your choice, unless you personally cancel the request.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Procedure</h3>

            <h4>Doing This Well</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Prefer a private space where you won't be disturbed</li>
                <li>Keep cameras and prying eyes away</li>
                <li>Avoid pronouncing the results out loud</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>A. Write the Seed Phrase</h4>
            <p>
                If you generated your seed phrase with Penlock, directly on the
                worksheet, then you can skip this section.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use the wordlist to find your words formatted the Penlock way,
                and copy the first 6 characters on the worksheet under the
                'Seedphrase' section, respecting the gray & white backgrounds
                coding.
            </p>

            <h4>B. Generate the Shares</h4>
            <p>
                The shares are generated sequentially, one character at a time.
                The first character of each share is produced from the first
                character of the seed phrase, and so on. Use a pencil for now,
                as corrections might be needed if a mistake occurs:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Move the wheel's pointer to the first character of the seed
                    phrase.
                </li>
                <li>Shuffle the tiles thoroughly and pick one at random.</li>
                <li>
                    On the wheel, find the window whose number matches the value
                    on the tile.
                </li>
                <li>If the seed phrase character is '=':</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On the worksheet, write the character from that window
                        as the first character for all three shares (as
                        indicated by the 'x3' mention).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Otherwise:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On the worksheet, write the character from that window
                        as the first character of 'Share 1'.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write the character from the next window (in numbering
                        order) as the first character of 'Share 2'. Note: The
                        numbering loops; the window after 29 is window 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you want a third share, write the character from the
                        window after that as the first character of Share 3.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Repeat steps 1 to 5 for each subsequent character until the
                    shares are complete.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>C. Verify the Shares</h4>
            <p>
                Before disposing of the cleartext seed phrase, it is of utmost
                importance to verify that all shares are correct. This is done
                by simulating the recovery process in a way that speeds up the
                verification. As before, we proceed sequentially, one character
                at a time:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Move the wheel's pointer to the first character of the seed
                    phrase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the wheel's inner character ring, locate the first
                    character of 'Share 1'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Verify that the character on the outer ring aligned with it
                    is the first character of 'Share 2'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If they do not match, the characters of all shares for this
                    position are erroneous and must be regenerated using the
                    steps in Section B.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you produced three shares: locate the first character of
                    'Share 2' on the inner ring and verify that the character on
                    the outer ring aligned with it is the first character of
                    'Share 3'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once again, if they do not match, the characters of all
                    shares for this position must be regenerated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat steps 1 to 6 for each subsequent character until the
                    shares are fully verified.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>D. Finalize the Shares</h4>
            <p>
                Assuming that 'Share 1' is stored digitally, it requires no
                further processing. 'Share 2' and 'Share 3', however, need to be
                traced over in pen, cut out, and possibly copied, depending on
                your backup strategy. Use the worksheet's extra shares for this
                purpose, ensuring you copy the data accurately and respect the
                share numbering.

                After cutting out these shares, fill out the back of each one by
                adding the date, the wallet brand and model, and the owner’s
                name or pseudonym. This prevents shares from different sets from
                being mixed up and simplifies the recovery process later.

            <h3>Notes on Storing the Shares</h3>
            <p>
                We recommend storing physical shares in waterproof, sealed
                containers such as opaque poly mailers. When entrusting a share
                to another person, ensure clear identifying information is
                written on the container and explain proper storage practices
                (e.g., keeping it dry, safe, and confidential).
            </p>
            <p>
                The legal share — if it is part of an inheritance plan — may be
                accompanied by the printed recovery guide and the required
                components, as detailed in that guide. This will simplify the
                recovery process for the beneficiary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The digital share must be entered with care and stored with the
                same identifying information as the other shares. Note that no
                other shares should ever be digitized, as this would weaken the
                security of the 2-of-3 backup.
