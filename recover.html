            <p>
                In addition to printing and assembling the components linked
                below, you will need a pencil, an eraser, and two Penlock shares
                that belong to the same set.

                    The worksheet is used to write the seed phrase during the
                    recovery process. Other sections (shares) are left unused.
                    Note that each word is made of 2 gray boxes
                    (Penlock-specific checksum), and 4 white boxes (truncated
                    seed word).

                    The wheel is the primary tool for recovering the seed
                    phrase. To assemble it, proceed with the following steps:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Print and carefully cut out both disks.</li>
                    <li>
                        On the colored disk, cut out the pointer window. The
                        smaller numbered windows are not needed for this
                        recovery process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Attach both disks together at their center using a snap
                        button, a brass fastener, or a pin. Ensure the colored
                        wheel is placed on top and can rotate freely.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The wheel has 4 distinct sections that will be referred to
                    as follows: the pointer, the outer (character) ring, the
                    inner (character) ring, and the numbered spiral.
                </p>

                <aside>
                    <em>Fraudproof:</em>
                    (If received from a third party) The characters on the outer
                    ring must be, in clockwise order: A to Z, -, =, #. When the
                    pointer is on '=', each character on the inner ring must be
                    aligned with and identical to the outer ring ones.

                    The sumtable is used to verify the recovery is error-free,

            <h3>Procedure</h3>

            <h4>Doing This Well</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Prefer a private space where you won't be disturbed</li>
                <li>Keep cameras and prying eyes away</li>
                <li>Avoid pronouncing the results out loud</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>A. Identify the Recovery Window and Share Position</h4>
            <p>
                The recovery window you need to use depends on which shares you
                are recovering from:
            </p>

            <div class="card">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <th>Inner Share</th>
                        <th></th>
                        <th>Outer Share</th>
                        <th></th>
                        <th>Recovery Window</th>
                    </thead>

                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Share 1</td>
                            <td>+</td>
                            <td>Share 2</td>
                            <td>→</td>
                            <td>Pointer (▼)</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Share 2</td>
                            <td>+</td>
                            <td>Share 3</td>
                            <td>→</td>
                            <td>Pointer (▼)</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Share 1</td>
                            <td>+</td>
                            <td>Share 3</td>
                            <td>→</td>
                            <td>Window 29→</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Using the table above, identify the correct recovery window
                    for your shares.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note which share is the inner share and which is the outer
                    share.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>B. Recover the Seed Phrase</h4>
            <p>
                The seed phrase is recovered character by character,
                sequentially. Proceed as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Read the first character of the inner share.</li>
                <li>On the wheel, locate this character on the inner ring.</li>
                <li>Read the first character of the outer share.</li>
                <li>On the wheel, locate this character on the outer ring.</li>
                <li>Rotate the wheel to align both characters.</li>
                <li>Read the resulting character from the recovery window.</li>
                <li>
                    On the worksheet, write this character as the first
                    character in the 'Seedphrase' section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat steps 1 to 7 for each subsequent character until all
                    the words are recovered.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>C. Check & Fix the Words</h4>
            <p>
                Look up each of the 12 words in the sumtable. If you find a
                match, the word is correct. You can then take note of the full
                word when they are longer than 4 characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a word does not match, an error has occurred — either during
                recovery or when the share was produced or copied. Follow these
                steps until you identify the correct word:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Repeat the recovery process from Section B for that specific
                    word. Pay close attention to characters that are easily
                    confused, such as E/F, O/Q, U/V, or X/Y. This may produce a
                    correct result.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If not, among words in the sumtable that start with the
                    <em>same two grayed checksum characters</em>, look for a
                    word that is similar but has one or two different
                    characters. This word is most likely the correct one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If no match is found in the sumtable, use the wordlist to
                    find a word that matches the <em>white characters</em> but
                    has one or two errors in the grayed checksum characters.
                    This word is most likely the correct one.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Notes on Initializing a Wallet</h3>
            <p>
                A few important notes on initializing a wallet from the
                recovered seed phrase:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Consult your wallet's documentation for specific
                    instructions on recovering from a seed phrase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enter only the white characters: the grayed checksum
                    characters are Penlock-specific.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Omit the dashes: they represent an empty character for
                    3-letter words.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hardware wallets typically only require the first 4 letters
                    of each word, while software wallets often require the full
                    word.
                </li>
